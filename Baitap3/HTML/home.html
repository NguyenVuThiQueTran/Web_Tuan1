            Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. such a smashing success!</span>
            After all of the hard work on rehearsals and set building and promotion, it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments on your wonderful performances.</p>
        <p> I've started putting up a 
        <a href="slide1.html"> slide show</a> of the production. Please feel free to download the files from the Web site. If you want high resolution photos on a photo CD, please contact me.</p>
        <p>Once again: <i><span style="color: rgb(160, 38, 38);">BRAVO!!!</span></i> -- Mrs. Juroszek
