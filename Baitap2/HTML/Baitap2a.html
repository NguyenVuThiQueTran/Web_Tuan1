            <h2> Leaonhard Eiler (1707-1783) </h2>
            <p> The greatest mathematician of the eighteennth century. <b>Leouhard Euler</b> was born is Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under nother giant
                of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathermatics at St.Peterburg Acadeny of Sciences. Euler was
                the most prolifie mathermatician of all time, publishing over  800 different books and papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. 
                Euler's work om mathermatical analysis. <i>Introductio in nanlysin infinitorum</i> (1748) remained a standard textbook for well over a century. 
                For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau he wrote <i>Lerrres a une princesse d'Allemagne</i> (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technial outline of the main physical theories of the time.

            <p> One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduce in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his resecarch into mathematical and analysis. Euler's formula
            </p>
            <p>cos(x) + isin(x)=e<sup>(ix)</sup>
            <p> demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation</p>
            <p>e <sup>(&#960;t)</sup>+1=0</p>
            <p>which relates the fundametal constants: 0, 1, &#960;, e, and single beautiful and elegant statement.</p>
            <p>Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>
